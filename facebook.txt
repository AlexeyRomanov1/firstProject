Hello, Facebook!

I hate posting.......

1. According to Wikipedia,

“The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal was a major political scandal in early 2018 when it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the personal data of millions of peoples’ Facebook profiles without their consent and used it for political advertising purposes.”

2. Fake Facebook Profiles

Although this violates Facebook’s rules, many fake Facebook accounts are bots.

People might try to begin relationships with people they meet on Facebook not realizing the user had a fake Facebook profile.
